Prompt Writing Basics (Reference: https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/image/img-gen-prompt-guide)
Subject: The first thing to think about with any prompt is the subject: the object, person, animal, or scenery you want an image of.

Context and background: Just as important is the background or context in which the subject will be placed. Try placing your subject in a variety of backgrounds. For example, a studio with a white background, outdoors, or indoor environments.

Style: Finally, add the style of image you want. Styles can be general (painting, photograph, sketches) or very specific (pastel painting, charcoal drawing, isometric 3D).
